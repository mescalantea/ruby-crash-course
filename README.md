Make sure that `bin/ruby` has the proper permissions. For that, you can execute:

```bash
sudo chmod +x bin/ruby
```

To run the scripts, type `bin/ruby` and the file name in your terminal:

```bash
./bin/ruby 01_print.rb
```

## Interactive Ruby

This repo provides a wrapper to run IRB. This tool allows you to start a playground to test your Ruby code directly at your terminal. Execute it this way:

```bash
./bin/irb
```
